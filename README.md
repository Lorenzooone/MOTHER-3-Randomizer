# MOTHER-3-Randomizer

This is the MOTHER 3 Randomizer's source.
I've commented it, but it's really messy.
If you need some help to get certain addresses of MOTHER 3, this is the place.

This has been compiled with the C++ 11 standard.

If you just want the build, go to the Release section or to:

Information source for many things I randomized: http://datacrystal.romhacking.net/wiki/MOTHER_3:ROM_map

Troubleshooting: If your character has 1 HP or 0 PP and they should have more, try checking the equipment. It may decrease the HPs/PPs to 0 or below.

CLEANUP IN PROGRESS. Also I don't really know C++ at all. Let's see how this goes ...

## Building
    git clone https://github.com/kashaiahyah85/MOTHER-3-Randomizer.git
    cd MOTHER-3-Randomizer
    make
    ./M3Randomizer
